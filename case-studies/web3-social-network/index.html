    <h1>Build a production level social network in 4 weeks</h1>

    <p><em>An ongoing product building a social network for a vertical community, using the same proven 4-week methodology with flexibility to adapt to project complexities.</em></p>

    <h2>Motivation & Challenge</h2>
    <p>Building a social network for a vertical community presents unique technical challenges. The project requires complex backend systems to handle user interactions, content management, and blockchain integrations, while maintaining a smooth and intuitive user experience. Our goal is to create a platform that serves a vertical community without overwhelming users with technical complexity.</p>

    <h2>Team & Collaboration</h2>
    <p>Similar to our Bible Project workflow, I'm working with partners who handle different aspects of the product:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>My Role (Developer):</strong> Technical implementation, backend systems, and feature prioritization. I consistently guide the team to evaluate business value versus development cost for each feature, ensuring we focus on what matters most.</li>
      <li><strong>Partner(s):</strong> UI design, marketing, and product management—working collaboratively to deliver a cohesive product</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4-Week Development Process</h2>
    
    <h3>Week 1: Core User Experience First</h3>
    <p>Given the backend complexity inherent in social networks, we made a strategic decision: build a working UI/UX application first. This allowed us to establish the major user experience flows before diving into the backend infrastructure. This approach ensures we're building the right features from a user perspective, not just technically feasible ones.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> A functional UI prototype showcasing core user experience flows and design direction.</p>

    <h3>Week 2: Backend Integration & MVP Completion</h3>
    <p>With the user experience defined, week two focused on building out the service side—implementing the backend systems, APIs, and integrations needed to make the app fully functional. We polished features and refined the user experience based on what we learned from week one.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> A fully functional MVP product with polished features and refined user experience, ready for internal team testing.</p>

    <h3>Week 3: Public Internal Testing Preparation</h3>
    <p>Week three involved defining a committed scope—a clear set of final tasks that needed completion before launching public internal testing. The development team focused on fixing bugs and adding missing critical features, while the marketing team organized focus groups to ensure we were moving in the same direction with the same goals.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Product launched into public internal testing phase, with feedback collection mechanisms in place.</p>

    <h3>Week 4: Publication (Upcoming)</h3>
    <p>The product is currently undergoing public internal testing, which requires time to gather meaningful feedback. Once we've collected and analyzed user feedback, we'll resume work for week four, which will focus on publishing the application on both App Store and Play Store based on the insights we've gained.</p>
    <p><strong>Current Status:</strong> Public internal testing in progress—collecting user feedback to inform final adjustments before publication.</p>

    <h2>Flexible Methodology & Key Principles</h2>
    <p>While we use the same 4-week template, it's intentionally flexible. Each week's theme doesn't have to be exactly the same across projects because different products have different needs. However, the structure provides valuable benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clear Weekly Themes:</strong> Each week has a focused goal, keeping the team aligned</li>
      <li><strong>Reasonable Timeline:</strong> Four weeks is achievable with AI assistance and limited resources, but still creates urgency that drives focused decision-making</li>
      <li><strong>Forced Prioritization:</strong> The time constraint ensures the team comes together regularly to discuss what truly matters, preventing feature bloat</li>
      <li><strong>Business Value Focus:</strong> My consistent reminders to estimate business value and development cost helps the team make data-driven decisions about feature priorities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This methodology has proven especially valuable in resource-constrained environments where AI tools help accelerate development, but the discipline of time limits ensures we build the right product, not just a technically impressive one.</p>

    <h2>Current Outcomes & Next Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Completed functional MVP with polished user experience and backend integration</li>
      <li>Successfully launched public internal testing phase</li>
      <li>Gathered focus group feedback to validate direction</li>
      <li>Organized team around clear scope and committed deliverables</li>
      <li><strong>Next:</strong> Analyze feedback, make final adjustments, and publish to App Store and Play Store</li>
    </ul>
