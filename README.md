# mylesieong.github.io

This is my personal website hosted on GitHub Pages. The site is built using Jekyll and markdown for simplicity and ease of maintenance.

## Structure

- `index.md` - Homepage
- `about.md` - About page
- `_config.yml` - Jekyll configuration
- `README.md` - This file

## Local Development

To run this site locally:

1. Install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll bundler`
2. Run: `bundle exec jekyll serve` (check it PATH contains gem lib bin if cmd not found)
3. Visit: `http://localhost:4000`

## Customization

Edit the markdown files to customize the content for your needs. The site uses GitHub Pages' default Jekyll theme for a clean, professional look.
