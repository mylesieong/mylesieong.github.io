    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Most news apps are designed to keep you addicted. We built Calmly News to do the opposite: keep you informed, and then help you get off your phone.</p>
    
    <p>We call it a "cooling system" for your digital life. It's not about ignoring the world; it's about engaging with it without burning out.</p>
    
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Just the facts</strong>: We use AI to strip away the "drama adjectives" and emotional language. You get the actual news, not the clickbait designed to make you angry or scared.</li>
      <li><strong>The Rule of 10</strong>: You don't need an endless feed. We limit you to the 10 most important stories of the day. Once you read them, the feed locks. You're done.</li>
      <li><strong>Mental Reset</strong>: Some news is just heavy. We've built in simple tools—like breathing exercises—to help you decompress immediately after reading a difficult story.</li>
      <li><strong>Filter your triggers</strong>: You decide what you see. Easily block specific topics or keywords that you aren't in the headspace to handle right now.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Mental health isn't about hiding from the truth. It's about having the emotional capacity to handle it.</p>
